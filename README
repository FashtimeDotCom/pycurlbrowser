pycurlbrowser

A minimal browser based on pycurl.

Mechanize seemed a bit slow for my usage, so I wrote this alternative using
pycurl (i.e. libcurl) and lxml, mostly focused on speed, whilst not compromising
on the features I see as useful (cookies and form selection/POSTing).

Plans:
    form support for radio, checkbox types
    decorator to catch errors and rethrow with attached browser data for easier
        scraper debugging
